        <h3>Addendum</h3>
        <h4>HTML:</h4>
        <p>For creating the game first, I used three div tags to hold the heading, main box and the counter and I used the
        CSS for alignment of these. The main box is divided into the grid dynamically by CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <h4>CSS:</h4>
        <p>First, I used CSS flex-box column flex on the body to align the contents of the body in vertical position and in
        the main box which is the game box, I used grid to divide the whole box into tiles. These grid boxes change
        color dynamically via js code.</p>
        <h4>JavaScript:</h4>
        <p>In JavaScript code, to make the game working, I used three functions: toggleCell, toggleAdjacentCell and
        increaseCount. When ever a cell is clicked, it calls and even listener which internally calls toggle cell
        function and in this function four toggleAdjacentCell function will be called for the current cell and an
        increaseCount function will also be called to increment the number of attempts. These toggle function alter the
        CSS of the cells to make them look like light on and light off.</p>

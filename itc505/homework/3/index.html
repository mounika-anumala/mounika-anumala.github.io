        <p class="ft1"><b>Font Selection:</b> One of the essential elements in web design is typography. Your choice of fonts can significantly impact the overall look and feel of your website. When creating a unique web experience, it's essential to choose a custom font that aligns with your design vision. Ensure that you have access to the specific font files you want to use.</p>
        
        <p><b>Create an HTML File:</b> Before you can apply a custom font to your web page, you need to create a basic HTML file. This file serves as the foundation for your web content and provides the structure within which your chosen font will be displayed.</p>
        
        <p class="ft2"><b>Research on Serving Fonts:</b> To seamlessly deliver a custom font to a client's browser, you can leverage the power of the @font-face rule in CSS. This rule empowers web developers to define and make custom fonts available to web browsers when they request a web page. The process involves specifying font formats and setting up your server to serve these fonts. Here are the general steps to achieve this:</p>

        <ul class="ft3">
            <li><b>Choose a Font:</b> Begin by selecting a unique and distinctive font that aligns with your website's branding and design goals. Ensure you have the necessary font files in formats like WOFF, WOFF2, TTF, or OTF.</li>
            <li><b>Create @font-face Rule:</b> Define an @font-face rule in your CSS stylesheet or within a style tag in your HTML document. This rule includes properties such as font-family and src, where you specify the path to your font files and their formats.</li>
            <li><b>Apply the Font:</b> After defining the @font-face rule, you can apply the custom font to various elements on your web page by setting the font-family property. Customize the styling to create a visually appealing and consistent design.</li>
            <li><b>Test and Verify:</b> It's crucial to test your web page across different browsers and devices to ensure that the custom font is rendering correctly. Be mindful of compatibility issues and make adjustments as needed.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="font3"><b>Upload Font Files to Your Server:</b> Once you've chosen your custom font and defined the @font-face rule, the next step is to upload the font files to your web server. Make sure to organize them in a directory of your choice, keeping the file paths accurate for proper delivery to client browsers.</p>
